Keepon-Drumming
===============

A simple drum pattern sequencer that interacts with a toy robot.

Goals for user experience:

1. The person who will use my project is: Children and people who feel like children. 

2. I will be happy my project exists if: It exists, and it can engage people with little experience making music.

3. The first 10 minutes of using/interacting with my project will look like: The user getting used to the interface quickly, and beginning to create drum patterns on their own. 

Goals for final week:

To have audio running by the end of the night (Done. Thanks Dawn).

To be able to present a functioning sequencer and successfully get keepon to respond to audio in any way.
